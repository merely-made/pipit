//! A 2.4 kbps LPC vocoder: 10th-order, 22.5 ms frames, 7 bytes each.
//!
//! Where ADPCM sends a cheaper description of the waveform, this sends no
//! waveform at all. Each frame carries only what it takes to *rebuild*
//! speech: is this voiced, at what pitch, through what vocal-tract shape,
//! at what energy. Ten reflection coefficients, a pitch, a gain, a voicing
//! bit. That is why it fits a LoRa link and why it sounds synthetic.
//!
//! # Relationship to FIPS-137
//!
//! This is built to the *structure* of LPC-10e, the 2.4 kbps US federal
//! standard: the same frame length, model order, parameter set, and bit
//! allocation. The quantizer tables are Pipit's own, because the standard's
//! tables were not available to implement from. **A Pipit LPC frame is
//! therefore not interchangeable with a FIPS-137 frame**, and this codec
//! does not claim that interoperability. A conformant variant, if it is
//! ever wanted, takes a new codec identifier rather than changing this one.
//!
//! # Measuring it
//!
//! Signal-to-noise ratio against the input is meaningless here and will
//! read as negative: the output is a resynthesis, not an approximation of
//! the original samples. What is meaningful is whether the spectral
//! envelope, pitch, voicing, and energy survive, which is what the tests
//! assert.
